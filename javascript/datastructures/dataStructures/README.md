What do they do?
    Data structures are collections of values, the relationships among them, and the functions or operations that can be applied to the data

Why so many?
    Different data strcutures excel at different things. Some are highly specialized, while other (like arrays) are more generally used

Why care?
    The more time you spend as a developer, the more likely you'll need to use one of these dada structures
    You've already worked with many of them unknowingly
    And, yes, interviews

The is no "Best One"    

Why learning then all?
    Working with map/location data? => Use a graph
    Need an ordere list with fast inserts/removals at the beginning and end? => Use a linked list
    Web scraping nested HTML? => Use a tree
    Need to wirte a scheduler? => Use a binary heap
