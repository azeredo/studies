Selection Sort

Similar to bubble sort, but instead of first placin large values into sorted position, it places small value sinto sorted position

Strategy
    Store the first element as the smallets value you've seend so far
    Compare this item to the next item in the arry until you find a smaller number
    If a smaller number is found, designate that smaller number to be the new minimum and continue until the end of the array
    If the minimum is no the value (index) you initially begar with, swap them
    Repeat this with the next element until the array is sorted
